= Appendix C Partitioning for Debian

== C.1 Deciding on Debian Partitions and Sizes

* At a bare minimum, GNU/Linux needs one partition for itself.
* You can have a single partition containing the entire operating system,
  applications, and your personal files.
* Most people feel that a separate swap partition is also a necessity,
  although it's not strictly true.
* "Swap" is scratch space for an operating system, which allows the system to
  use disk storage as "virtual memory".
* By putting swap on a separate partition, Linux can make much more efficient
  use of it.
* It is possible to force Linux to use a regular file as swap, but it is not
  recommended.

'''

* Most people choose to give GNU/Linux more than the minimum number of
  partitions, however.
* There are two reasons you might want to break up the file system into a
  number of smaller partitions.
* The first is for safety.
* If something happens to corrupt the file system, generally only one
  partition is affected.
* Thus, you only have to replace (from the backups you've been carefully
  keeping) a portion of your system.
* At a bare minimum, you should consider creating what is commonly called a
  "root partition".
* This contains the most essential components of the system.
* If any other partitions get corrupted, you can still boot into GNU/Linux to
  fix the system.
* This can save you the trouble of having to reinstall the system from
  scratch.

'''

* The second reason is generally more important in a business setting, but it
  really depends on your use of the machine.
* For example, a mail server getting spammed with e-mail can easily fill a
  partition.
* If you made `/var/mail` a separate partition on the mail server, most of the
  system will remain working even if you get spammed.

'''

* The only real drawback to using more partitions is that it is often
  difficult to know in advance what your needs will be.
* If you make a partition too small then you will either have to reinstall the
  system or you will be constantly moving things around to make room in the
  undersized partition.
* On the other hand, if you make the partition too big, you will be wasting
  space that could be used elsewhere.
* Disk space is cheap nowadays, but why throw your money away?

== C.2 The Directory Tree

* Debian GNU/Linux adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for directory
  and file naming.
* This standard allows users and software programs to predict the location of
  files and directories.
* The root level directory is represented simply by the slash `/`.
* At the root level, all Debian systems include these directories:

[%autowidth,cols="m,d"]
|===
|Directory	|Content

|bin		|Essential command binaries
|boot		|Static files of the boot loader
|dev		|Device files
|etc		|Host-specific system configuration
|home		|User home directories
|lib		|Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
|media		|Contains mount points for replaceable media
|mnt		|Mount point for mounting a file system temporarily
|proc		|Virtual directory for system information
|root		|Home directory for the root user
|run		|Run-time variable data
|sbin		|Essential system binaries
|sys		|Virtual directory for system information
|tmp		|Temporary files
|usr		|Secondary hierarchy
|var		|Variable data
|srv		|Data for services provided by the system
|opt		|Add-on application software packages
|===

* The following is a list of important considerations regarding directories
  and partitions.
* Note that disk usage varies widely given system configuration and specific
  usage patterns.
* The recommendations here are general guidelines and provide a starting point
  for partitioning.
** The root partition `/` must always physically contain `/etc`, `/bin`,
   `/sbin`, `/lib`, `/dev` and `/usr`, otherwise you won't be able to boot. +
   This means that you should provide at least 600-750MB of disk space for the
   root partition including `/usr`, or 5-6GB for a workstation or a server
   installation.
** `/var`: variable data like news articles, e-mails, web sites, databases,
   the packaging system cache, etc. will be placed under this directory. +
   The size of this directory depends greatly on the usage of your system, but
   for most people will be dictated by the package management tool's
   overhead. + 
   If you are going to do a full installation of just about everything Debian
   has to offer, all in one session, setting aside 2 or 3 GB of space for
   `/var` should be sufficient. +
   If you are going to install in pieces (that is to say, install services and
   utilities, followed by text stuff, then X, ...), you can get away with
   300-500 MB. +
** If hard drive space is at a premium and you don't plan on doing major
   system updates, you can get by with as little as 30 or 40 MB.
** `/tmp`: temporary data created by programs will most likely go in this
   directory. +
   40-100MB should usually be enough. +
   Some applications -- including archive manipulators, CD/DVD authoring
   tools, and multimedia software -- may use `/tmp` to temporarily store image
   files. +
   If you plan to use such applications, you should adjust the space available
   in `/tmp` accordingly.
** `/home`: every user will put his personal data into a subdirectory of this
   directory. +
   Its size depends on how many users will be using the system and what files
   are to be stored in their directories. +
   Depending on your planned usage you should reserve about 100MB for each
   user, but adapt this value to your needs.
   Reserve a lot more space if you plan to save a lot of multimedia files
   (pictures, MP3, movies) in your home directory.

== C.3 Recommended Partitioning Scheme

* For new users, personal Debian boxes, home systems, and other single-user
  setups, a single `/` partition (plus swap) is probably the easiest, simplest
  way to go.
* The recommended partition type is ext4.

'''

* For multi-user systems or systems with lots of disk space, it's best to put
  `/var`, `/tmp`, and `/home` each on their own partitions separate from the
  `/` partition.

'''

* You might need a separate `/usr/local` partition if you plan to install many
  programs that are not part of the Debian distribution.
* If your machine will be a mail server, you might need to make `/var/mail` a
  separate partition.
* If you are setting up a server with lots of user accounts, it's generally
  good to have a separate, large `/home` partition.
* In general, the partitioning situation varies from computer to computer
  depending on its uses.

'''

* For very complex systems, you should see the Multi Disk HOWTO.
* This contains in-depth information, mostly of interest to ISPs and people
  setting up servers.

'''

* With respect to the issue of swap partition size, there are many views.
* One rule of thumb which works well is to use as much swap as you have system
  memory.
* It also shouldn't be smaller than 512MB, in most cases.
* Of course, there are exceptions to these rules.

'''

* As an example, an older home machine might have 512MB of RAM and a 20GB SATA
  drive on `/dev/sda`.
* There might be a 8GB partition for another operating system on `/dev/sda1`, a
  512MB swap partition on `/dev/sda3` and about 11.4GB on `/dev/sda2` as the
  Linux partition. 

'''

* For an idea of the space taken by tasks you might be interested in adding
  after your system installation is complete, check Section D.2.

== C.4 Device Names in Linux

* Linux disks and partition names may be different from other operating
  systems.
* You need to know the names that Linux uses when you create and mount
  partitions.
* Here's the basic naming scheme:
** The first hard disk detected is named `/dev/sda`.
** The second hard disk detected is named `/dev/sdb`, and so on.
** The first SCSI CD-ROM is named `/dev/scd0`, also known as `/dev/sr0`.

* The partitions on each disk are represented by appending a decimal number to
  the disk name: `sda1` and `sda2` represent the first and second partitions of
  the first SCSI disk drive in your system.

'''

* Here is a real-life example.
* Let's assume you have a system with 2 SCSI disks, one at SCSI address 2 and
  the other at SCSI address 4.
* The first disk (at address 2) is then named `sda`, and the second `sdb`.
* If the `sda` drive has 3 partitions on it, these will be named `sda1`,
  `sda2`, and `sda3`.
* The same applies to the `sdb` disk and its partitions.

'''

* Note that if you have two SCSI host bus adapters (i.e., controllers), the
  order of the drives can get confusing.
* The best solution in this case is to watch the boot messages, assuming you
  know the drive models and/or capacities.

'''

* Linux represents the primary partitions as the drive name, plus the numbers
  1 through 4.
* For example, the first primary partition on the first drive is `/dev/sda1`.
* The logical partitions are numbered starting at 5, so the first logical
  partition on that same drive is `/dev/sda5`.
* Remember that the extended partition, that is, the primary partition holding
  the logical partitions, is not usable by itself.

== C.5 Debian Partitioning Programs

* Several varieties of partitioning programs have been adapted by Debian
  developers to work on various types of hard disks and computer
  architectures.
* Following is a list of the program(s) applicable for your architecture.
partman::
** Recommended partitioning tool in Debian.
** This Swiss army knife can also resize partitions, create filesystems
   and assign them to the mountpoints.

fdisk::
** The original Linux disk partitioner, good for gurus.
** Be careful if you have existing FreeBSD partitions on your machine.
** The installation kernels include support for these partitions, but the way
   that fdisk represents them (or not) can make the device names differ.
** See the Linux+FreeBSD HOWTO.

cfdisk::
** A simple-to-use, full-screen disk partitioner for the rest of us.
** Note that *cfdisk* doesn't understand FreeBSD partitions at all, and,
   again, device names may differ as a result.

'''

* One of these programs will be run by default when you select Partition disks
  (or similar).
* It may be possible to use a different partitioning tool from the command
  line on VT2, but this is not recommended.

'''

* Remember to mark your boot partition as "Bootable".

=== C.5.1 Partitioning for 64-bit PC

* If you are using a new harddisk (or want to wipe out the whole partition
  table of your disk), a new partition table needs to be created.
* The "Guided partitioning" does this automatically, but when partitioning
  manually, move the selection on the top-level entry of the disk and hit
  Enter.
* That will create a new partition table on that disk.
* In expert mode, you will then be asked for the type of the partition table.
* Default for UEFI-based systems is "gpt", while for the older BIOS world the
  default value is "msdos".
* In a standard priority installation those defaults will be used
  automatically.

[NOTE]
====
* When a partition table with type "gpt" was selected (default for UEFI
  systems), a free space of 1 MB will automatically get created at the
  beginning of the disk.
* This is intended and required to embed the GRUB2 bootloader.
====

* If you have an existing other operating system such as DOS or Windows and
  you want to preserve that operating system while installing Debian, you may
  need to resize its partition to free up space for the Debian installation.
* The installer supports resizing of both FAT and NTFS filesystems; when you
  get to the installer's partitioning step, select the option Manual and then
  simply select an existing partition and change its size.

'''

* While modern UEFI systems don't have such limitations as listed below, the
  old PC BIOS generally adds additional constraints for disk partitioning.
* There is a limit to how many "primary" and "logical" partitions a drive can
  contain.
* Additionally, with pre 1994-98 BIOSes, there are limits to where on the
  drive the BIOS can boot from.
* More information can be found in the Linux Partition HOWTO, but this section
  will include a brief overview to help you plan most situations.

'''

* "Primary" partitions are the original partitioning scheme for PC disks.
* However, there can only be four of them.
* To get past this limitation, "extended" and "logical" partitions were
  invented.
* By setting one of your primary partitions as an extended partition, you can
  subdivide all the space allocated to that partition into logical partitions.
* You can create up to 60 logical partitions per extended partition; however,
  you can only have one extended partition per drive.
