= Chapter 8 Next Steps and Where to Go From Here

== 8.1 Shutting down the system

* To shut down a running Debian GNU/Linux system, you must not reboot with the
  reset switch on the front or back of your computer, or just turn off the
  computer.
* Debian GNU/Linux should be shut down in a controlled manner, otherwise files
  might get lost and/or disk damage might occur.
* If you run a desktop environment, there is usually an option to "log out"
  available from the application menu that allows you to shutdown (or reboot)
  the system.

'''

* Alternatively you can press the key combination kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Del].
* If the key combinations do not work, a last option is to log in as root and
  type the necessary commands.
* Use *reboot* to reboot the system.
* Use *halt* to halt the system without powering it off.
* To power off the machine, use *poweroff* or *shutdown -h now*.
* The systemd init system provides additional commands that perform the same
  functions; for example *systemctl reboot* or *systemctl poweroff*.

== 8.2 Orienting Yourself to Debian

* Debian is a little different from other distributions.
* Even if you're familiar with Linux in other distributions, there are things
  you should know about Debian to help you to keep your system in a good,
  clean state.
* This chapter contains material to help you get oriented; it is not intended
  to be a tutorial for how to use Debian, but just a very brief glimpse of the
  system for the very rushed.

=== 8.2.1 Debian Packaging System

* The most important concept to grasp is the Debian packaging system.
* In essence, large parts of your system should be considered under the
  control of the packaging system.
* These include:
** `/usr` (excluding `/usr/local`)
** `/var` (you could make `/var/local` and be safe in there)
** `/bin`
** `/sbin`
** `/lib`

* For instance, if you replace `/usr/bin/perl`, that will work, but then if
  you upgrade your perl package, the file you put there will be replaced.
* Experts can get around this by putting packages on "hold" in *aptitude*.

'''

* One of the best installation methods is apt.
* You can use the command line version of *apt* as well as tools like aptitude
  or synaptic (which are just graphical frontends for *apt*).
* Note that apt will also let you merge main, contrib, non-free, and
  non-free-firmware so you can have restricted packages (strictly speaking not
  belonging to Debian) as well as packages from Debian GNU/Linux at the same
  time.

=== 8.2.4 Cron Job Management

* Any jobs under the purview of the system administrator should be in `/etc`,
  since they are configuration files.
* If you have a root cron job for daily, weekly, or monthly runs, put them in
  `/etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly}`.
* These are invoked from `/etc/crontab`, and will run in alphabetic order, which
  serializes them.

'''

* On the other hand, if you have a cron job that (a) needs to run as a special
  user, or (b) needs to run at a special time or frequency, you can use either
  `/etc/crontab`, or, better yet, `/etc/cron.d/whatever`.
* These particular files also have an extra field that allows you to stipulate
  the user account under which the cron job runs.

'''

* In either case, you just edit the files and cron will notice them
  automatically.
* There is no need to run a special command.
* For more information see cron(8), crontab(5), and
  `/usr/share/doc/cron/README.Debian`.
