= Chapter 6 Using the Debian Installer
:toc: left
:experimental:

== 6.1 How the Installer Works

* For this architecture the `debian-installer` supports two different user
  interfaces: a graphical one and a text-based one.
* The graphical interface is used by default unless you select an "Install"
  option in the boot menu.
* For more information about booting the graphical installer, please refer to
  _Section 5.1.6_.

'''

* The Debian Installer consists of a number of special-purpose components to
  perform each installation task.
* Each component performs its task, asking the user questions as necessary to
  do its job.
* The questions themselves are given priorities, and the priority of questions
  to be asked is set when the installer is started.

'''

* When a default installation is performed, only essential (high priority)
  questions will be asked.
* This results in a highly automated installation process with little user
  interaction.
* Components are automatically run in sequence; which components are run
  depends mainly on the installation method you use and on your hardware.
* The installer will use default values for questions that are not asked.

'''

* If there is a problem, the user will see an error screen, and the installer
  menu may be shown in order to select some alternative action.
* If there are no problems, the user will never see the installer menu, but
  will simply answer questions for each component in turn.
* Serious error notifications are set to priority "critical" so the user will
  always be notified.

'''

* In the text-based environment the use of a mouse is not supported.
* Here are the keys you can use to navigate within the various dialogs.
* The kbd:[Tab] or kbd:[right] arrow keys move "forward", and the
  kbd:[Shift+Tab] or kbd:[left] arrow keys move "backward" between displayed
  buttons and selections.
* The kbd:[up] and kbd:[down] arrow select different items within a scrollable
  list, and also scroll the list itself.
* In addition, in long lists, you can type a letter to cause the list to
  scroll directly to the section with items starting with the letter you typed
  and use kbd:[Pg-Up] and kbd:[Pg-Down] to scroll the list in sections.
* The kbd:[space bar] selects an item such as a checkbox.
* Use kbd:[Enter] to activate choices.

'''

* Some dialogs may offer additional help information.
* If help is available this will be indicated on the bottom line of the screen
  by displaying that help information can be accessed by pressing the kbd:[F1]
  key.

'''

* Error messages and logs are redirected to the fourth console.
* You can access this console by pressing kbd:[Left Alt+F4] (hold the left Alt
  key while pressing the F4 function key); get back to the main installer
  process with kbd:[Left Alt+F1].

'''

* These messages can also be found in `/var/log/syslog`.
* After installation, this log is copied to `/var/log/installer/syslog` on
  your new system.
* Other installation messages may be found in `/var/log/` during the
  installation, and `/var/log/installer/` after the computer has been booted
  into the installed system.

== 6.2 Components Introduction

* Here is a list of installer components with a brief description of each
  component's purpose.
* Details you might need to know about using a particular component are in
  Section 6.3.

'''

main-menu::
* Shows the list of components to the user during installer operation, and
   starts a component when it is selected.
* Main-menu's questions are set to priority medium, so if your priority is
   set to high or critical (high is the default), you will not see the menu.
* On the other hand, if there is an error which requires your intervention,
   the question priority may be downgraded temporarily to allow you to resolve
   the problem, and in that case the menu may appear.
+
'''

* You can get to the main menu by selecting the Go Back button repeatedly to
  back all the way out of the currently running component.

localechooser::
* Allows the user to select localization options for the installation and the
  installed system: language, country and locales.
* The installer will display messages in the selected language, unless the
  translation for that language is not complete in which case some messages
  may be shown in English.

console-setup::
* Shows a list of keyboard (layouts), from which the user chooses the one
  which matches his own model.

hw-detect::
* Automatically detects most of the system's hardware, including network
  cards, disk drives, and PCMCIA.

cdrom-detect::
* Looks for and mounts a Debian installation media.

netcfg::
* Configures the computer's network connections so it can communicate over the
  internet.

iso-scan::
* Searches for ISO images (.iso files) on hard drives.

choose-mirror::
* Presents a list of Debian archive mirrors.
* The user may choose the source of his installation packages.

cdrom-checker::
* Checks integrity of installation media.
* This way, the user may assure him/herself that the installation image was
  not corrupted.

lowmem::
* Lowmem tries to detect systems with low memory and then does various tricks
  to remove unnecessary parts of `debian-installer` from the memory (at the cost
  of some features).

anna::
* Anna's Not Nearly APT.
* Installs packages which have been retrieved from the chosen mirror or
  installation media.

user-setup::
* Sets up the root password, and adds a non-root user.

clock-setup::
* Updates the system clock and determines whether the clock is set to UTC or
  not.

tzsetup::
* Selects the time zone, based on the location selected earlier.

partman::
* Allows the user to partition disks attached to the system, create file
  systems on the selected partitions, and attach them to the mountpoints.
* Included are also interesting features like a fully automatic mode or LVM
  support.
* This is the preferred partitioning tool in Debian.

partman-lvm::
* Helps the user with the configuration of the LVM (Logical Volume Manager).

partman-md::
* Allows the user to set up Software RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive
  Disks).
* This Software RAID is usually superior to the cheap IDE (pseudo hardware)
  RAID controllers found on newer motherboards.

base-installer::
* Installs the most basic set of packages which would allow the computer to
  operate under Debian GNU/Linux when rebooted.

apt-setup::
* Configures apt, mostly automatically, based on what media the installer is
  running from.

pkgsel::
* Uses tasksel to select and install additional software.

os-prober::
* Detects currently installed operating systems on the computer and passes
  this information to the bootloaderinstaller, which may offer you an ability
  to add discovered operating systems to the bootloader's start menu.
* This way the user could easily choose at the boot time which operating
  system to start.

bootloader-installer::
* The various bootloader installers each install a boot loader program on the
  hard disk, which is necessary for the computer to start up using Linux
  without using a USB stick or CD-ROM.
* Many boot loaders allow the user to choose an alternate operating system
  each time the computer boots.

shell::
* Allows the user to execute a shell from the menu, or in the second console.

save-logs::
* Provides a way for the user to record information on a USB stick, network,
  hard disk, or other media when trouble is encountered, in order to
  accurately report installer software problems to Debian developers later.

== 6.3 Using Individual Components

* In this section we will describe each installer component in detail.
* The components have been grouped into stages that should be recognizable for
  users.
* They are presented in the order they appear during the install.
* Note that not all modules will be used for every installation; which modules
  are actually used depends on the installation method you use and on your
  hardware.

=== 6.3.1 Setting up Debian Installer and Hardware Configuration

* Let's assume the Debian Installer has booted and you are facing its first
  screen.
* At this time, the capabilities of `debian-installer` are still quite
  limited.
* It doesn't know much about your hardware, preferred language, or even the
  task it should perform.
* Don't worry.
* Because `debian-installer` is quite clever, it can automatically probe your
  hardware, locate the rest of its components and upgrade itself to a capable
  installation system.
* However, you still need to help `debian-installer` with some information it
  can't determine automatically (like selecting your preferred language,
  keyboard layout or desired network mirror).

'''

* You will notice that `debian-installer` performs hardware detection several
  times during this stage.
* The first time is targeted specifically at the hardware needed to load
  installer components (e.g. your CD-ROM or network card).
* As not all drivers may be available during this first run, hardware
  detection needs to be repeated later in the process.

'''

* During hardware detection `debian-installer` checks if any of the drivers for
  the hardware devices in your system require firmware to be loaded.
* If any firmware is requested but unavailable, a dialog will be displayed
  that allows the missing firmware to be loaded from a removable medium.
* See Section 6.4 for further details.

==== 6.3.1.1 Check available memory / low memory mode

* One of the first things `debian-installer` does, is to check available
  memory.
* If the available memory is limited, this component will make some changes in
  the installation process which hopefully will allow you to install Debian
  GNU/Linux on your system.

'''

* The first measure taken to reduce memory consumption by the installer is to
  disable translations, which means that the installation can only be done in
  English.
* Of course, you can still localize the installed system after the
  installation has completed.
* If that is not sufficient, the installer will further reduce memory
  consumption by loading only those components essential to complete a basic
  installation.
* This reduces the functionality of the installation system.
* You will be given the opportunity to load additional components manually,
  but you should be aware that each component you select will use additional
  memory and thus may cause the installation to fail.

'''

* If the installer runs in low memory mode, it is recommended to create a
  relatively large swap partition (64-128MB).
* The swap partition will be used as virtual memory and thus increases the
  amount of memory available to the system.
* The installer will activate the swap partition as early as possible in the
  installation process.
* Note that heavy use of swap will reduce performance of your system and may
  lead to high disk activity.

'''

* Despite these measures, it is still possible that your system freezes, that
  unexpected errors occur or that processes are killed by the kernel because
  the system runs out of memory (which will result in "Out of memory" messages
  on VT4 and in the syslog).

'''

* For example, it has been reported that creating a big ext3 file system fails
  in low memory mode when there is insufficient swap space.
* If a larger swap doesn't help, try creating the file system as ext2 (which
  is an essential component of the installer) instead.
* It is possible to change an ext2 partition to ext3 after the installation.

'''

* It is possible to force the installer to use a higher lowmem level than the
  one based on available memory by using the boot parameter "lowmem" as
  described in Section 5.3.2.

=== 6.3.4 Partitioning and Mount Point Selection

* At this time, after hardware detection has been executed a final time,
  `debian-installer` should be at its full strength, customized for the user's
  needs and ready to do some real work.
* As the title of this section indicates, the main task of the next few
  components lies in partitioning your disks, creating filesystems, assigning
  mountpoints and optionally configuring closely related options like RAID,
  LVM or encrypted devices.

'''

* If you are uncomfortable with partitioning, or just want to know more
  details, see Appendix C.

'''

* First you will be given the opportunity to automatically partition either an
  entire drive, or available free space on a drive.
* This is also called "guided" partitioning.
* If you do not want to autopartition, choose Manual from the menu.

==== 6.3.4.2 Guided Partitioning

* If you choose guided partitioning, you may have three options: to create
  partitions directly on the hard disk (classic method), or to create them
  using Logical Volume Management (LVM), or to create them using encrypted
  LVM.

[NOTE]
====
* The option to use (encrypted) LVM may not be available on all architectures.
====

* When using LVM or encrypted LVM, the installer will create most partitions
  inside one big partition; the advantage of this method is that partitions
  inside this big partition can be resized relatively easily later.
* In the case of encrypted LVM the big partition will not be readable without
  knowing a special key phrase, thus providing extra security of your
  (personal) data.

'''

* When using encrypted LVM, the installer will also automatically erase the
  disk by writing random data to it.
* This further improves security (as it makes it impossible to tell which
  parts of the disk are in use and also makes sure that any traces of previous
  installations are erased), but may take some time depending on the size of
  your disk.

[NOTE]
====
* If you choose guided partitioning using LVM or encrypted LVM, some changes
  in the partition table will need to be written to the selected disk while
  LVM is being set up.
* These changes effectively erase all data that is currently on the selected
  hard disk and you will not be able to undo them later.
* However, the installer will ask you to confirm these changes before they are
  written to disk.
====

* If you choose guided partitioning (either classic or using (encrypted) LVM)
  for a whole disk, you will first be asked to select the disk you want to
  use.
* Check that all your disks are listed and, if you have several disks, make
  sure you select the correct one.
* The order they are listed in may differ from what you are used to.
* The size of the disks may help to identify them.

'''

* Any data on the disk you select will eventually be lost, but you will always
  be asked to confirm any changes before they are written to the disk.
* If you have selected the classic method of partitioning, you will be able to
  undo any changes right until the end; when using (encrypted) LVM this is not
  possible.

'''

* Next, you will be able to choose from the schemes listed in the table below.
* All schemes have their pros and cons, some of which are discussed in
  Appendix C.
* If you are unsure, choose the first one.
* Bear in mind that guided partitioning needs a certain minimal amount of free
  space to operate with.
* If you don't give it at least about 1GB of space (depends on chosen scheme),
  guided partitioning will fail.

[%autowidth]
|===
|Partitioning scheme		|Minimum space	|Created partitions

|All files in one partition	|600MB		|`/`, swap
|Separate `/home` partition	|500MB		|`/`, `/home`, swap
|Separate `/home`, `/var` and `/tmp` partitions
				|1GB		|`/`, `/home`, `/tmp`, swap
|===

* If you choose guided partitioning using (encrypted) LVM, the installer will
  also create a separate `/boot` partition.
* The other partitions, including the swap partition, will be created inside
  the LVM partition.

'''

* If you have booted in EFI mode then within the guided partitioning setup
  there will be an additional partition, formatted as a FAT32 bootable
  filesystem, for the EFI boot loader.
* This partition is known as an EFI System Partition (ESP).
* There is also an additional menu item in the formatting menu to manually set
  up a partition as an ESP.

'''

* After selecting a scheme, the next screen will show your new partition
  table, including information on whether and how partitions will be formatted
  and where they will be mounted.

'''

* The list of partitions might look like this:
+
....
SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) - 6.4 GB WDC AC36400L
      #1 primary   16.4 MB  B f ext2       /boot
      #2 primary  551.0 MB      swap       swap
      #3 primary    5.8 GB      ntfs
         pri/log    8.2 MB      FREE SPACE

SCSI2 (1,0,0) (sdb) - 80.0 GB ST380021A
      #1 primary   15.9 MB      ext3
      #2 primary  996.0 MB      fat16
      #3 primary    3.9 GB      xfs        /home
      #5 logical    6.0 GB    f ext4       /
      #6 logical    1.0 GB    f ext3       /var
      #7 logical  498.8 MB      ext3
....

* This example shows two hard drives divided into several partitions; the
  first disk has some free space.
* Each partition line consists of the partition number, its type, size,
  optional flags, file system, and mountpoint (if any).
* Note: this particular setup cannot be created using guided partitioning but
  it does show possible variation that can be achieved using manual
  partitioning.

'''

* This concludes the guided partitioning.
* If you are satisfied with the generated partition table, you can choose
  Finish partitioning and write changes to disk from the menu to implement the
  new partition table (as described at the end of this section).
* If you are not happy, you can choose to Undo changes to partitions and run
  guided partitioning again, or modify the proposed changes as described below
  for manual partitioning.

==== 6.3.4.3 Manual Partitioning

* A similar screen to the one shown just above will be displayed if you choose
  manual partitioning except that your existing partition table will be shown
  and without the mount points.
* How to manually set up your partition table and the usage of partitions by
  your new Debian system will be covered in the remainder of this section.

'''

* If you select a pristine disk which has neither partitions nor free space on
  it, you will be asked if a new partition table should be created (this is
  needed so you can create new partitions).
* After this, a new line entitled "FREE SPACE" should appear in the table
  under the selected disk.

'''

* If you select some free space, you will have the opportunity to create a new
  partition.
* You will have to answer a quick series of questions about its size, type
  (primary or logical), and location (beginning or end of the free space).
* After this, you will be presented with a detailed overview of your new
  partition.
* The main setting is Use as:, which determines if the partition will have a
  file system on it, or be used for swap, software RAID, LVM, an encrypted
  file system, or not be used at all.
* Other settings include mountpoint, mount options, and bootable flag; which
  settings are shown depends on how the partition is to be used.
* If you don't like the preselected defaults, feel free to change them to your
  liking.
* E.g. by selecting the option Use as:, you can choose a different filesystem
  for this partition, including options to use the partition for swap,
  software RAID, LVM, or not use it at all.
* When you are satisfied with your new partition, select Done setting up the
  partition and you will return to partman's main screen.

'''

* If you decide you want to change something about your partition, simply
  select the partition, which will bring you to the partition configuration
  menu.
* This is the same screen as is used when creating a new partition, so you can
  change the same settings.
* One thing that may not be very obvious at a first glance is that you can
  resize the partition by selecting the item displaying the size of the
  partition.
* Filesystems known to work are at least fat16, fat32, ext2, ext3 and swap.
* This menu also allows you to delete a partition.

'''

* Be sure to create at least two partitions: one for the _root_ filesystem
  (which must be mounted as `/`) and one for swap.
* If you forget to mount the root filesystem, *partman* won't let you continue
  until you correct this issue.

'''

* If you boot in EFI mode but forget to select and format an EFI System
  Partition, *partman* will detect this and will not let you continue until
  you allocate one.

'''

* Capabilities of *partman* can be extended with installer modules, but are
  dependent on your system's architecture.
* So if you can't see all promised goodies, check if you have loaded all
  required modules (e.g. partman-ext3, partman-xfs, or partman-lvm).

'''

* After you are satisfied with partitioning, select Finish partitioning and
  write changes to disk from the partitioning menu.
* You will be presented with a summary of changes made to the disks and asked
  to confirm that the filesystems should be created as requested.

==== 6.3.4.5 Configuring the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)

* If you are working with computers at the level of system administrator or
  "advanced" user, you have surely seen the situation where some disk
  partition (usually the most important one) was short on space, while some
  other partition was grossly underused and you had to manage this situation
  by moving stuff around, symlinking, etc.

'''

* To avoid the described situation you can use Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
* Simply said, with LVM you can combine your partitions (_physical volumes_ in
  LVM lingo) to form a virtual disk (so called volume group), which can then
  be divided into virtual partitions (_logical volumes_).
* The point is that logical volumes (and of course underlying volume groups)
  can span across several physical disks.

'''

* Now when you realize you need more space for your old 160GB `/home`
  partition, you can simply add a new 300GB disk to the computer, join it with
  your existing volume group and then resize the logical volume which holds
  your `/home` filesystem and voila -- your users have some room again on
  their renewed 460GB partition.
* This example is of course a bit oversimplified.
* If you haven't read it yet, you should consult the LVM HOWTO.

'''

* LVM setup in `debian-installer` is quite simple and completely supported
  inside *partman*.
* First, you have to mark the partition(s) to be used as physical volumes for
  LVM.
* This is done in the Partition settings menu where you should select Use as:
  -> physical volume for LVM.

[WARNING]
====
* Be aware: the new LVM setup will destroy all data on all partitions marked
  with an LVM type code.
* So, if you already have an LVM on some of your disks, and want to install
  Debian additionally to that machine, the old (already existing) LVM will be
  wiped out!
* The same counts for partitions, which are (for any reason) misleadingly
  marked with an LVM type code, but contain something different (like an
  encrypted volume).
* You need to remove such disks from the system, before performing a new LVM
  setup!
====

* When you return to the main *partman* screen, you will see a new option
  Configure the Logical Volume Manager.
* When you select that, you will first be asked to confirm pending changes to
  the partition table (if any) and after that the LVM configuration menu will
  be shown.
* Above the menu a summary of the LVM configuration is shown.
* The menu itself is context sensitive and only shows valid actions.
* The possible actions are:
** Display configuration details: shows LVM device structure, names and sizes
   of logical volumes and more
** Create volume group
** Create logical volume
** Delete volume group
** Delete logical volume
** Extend volume group
** Reduce volume group
** Finish: return to the main *partman* screen

* Use the options in that menu to first create a volume group and then create
  your logical volumes inside it.

'''

* After you return to the main *partman* screen, any created logical volumes
  will be displayed in the same way as ordinary partitions (and you should
  treat them as such).

==== 6.3.4.6 Configuring Encrypted Volumes

* `debian-installer` allows you to set up encrypted partitions.
* Every file you write to such a partition is immediately saved to the device
  in encrypted form.
* Access to the encrypted data is granted only after entering the passphrase
  used when the encrypted partition was originally created.
* This feature is useful to protect sensitive data in case your laptop or hard
  drive gets stolen.
* The thief might get physical access to the hard drive, but without knowing
  the right passphrase, the data on the hard drive will look like random
  characters.

'''

* The two most important partitions to encrypt are: the home partition, where
  your private data resides, and the swap partition, where sensitive data
  might be stored temporarily during operation.
* Of course, nothing prevents you from encrypting any other partitions that
  might be of interest.
* For example `/var` where database servers, mail servers or print servers store
  their data, or `/tmp` which is used by various programs to store potentially
  interesting temporary files.
* Some people may even want to encrypt their whole system.
* Generally the only exception here is the `/boot` partition which must remain
  unencrypted, because historically there was no way to load the kernel from
  an encrypted partition.
* (GRUB is now able to do that, but `debian-installer` currently lacks native
  support for encrypted `/boot`. +
  The setup is therefore covered in a separate document.)

[NOTE]
====
* Please note that the performance of encrypted partitions will be less than
  that of unencrypted ones because the data needs to be decrypted or encrypted
  for every read or write.
* The performance impact depends on your CPU speed, chosen cipher and a key
  length.
====

* To use encryption, you have to create a new partition by selecting some free
  space in the main partitioning menu.
* Another option is to choose an existing partition (e.g. a regular partition,
  an LVM logical volume or a RAID volume).
* In the Partition settings menu, you need to select physical volume for
  encryption at the Use as: option.
* The menu will then change to include several cryptographic options for the
  partition.

'''

* The encryption method supported by `debian-installer` is _dm-crypt_
  (included in newer Linux kernels, able to host LVM physical volumes).

'''

* As always: when in doubt, use the defaults, because they have been carefully
  chosen with security in mind.

'''

* After you have selected the desired parameters for your encrypted
  partitions, return back to the main partitioning menu.
* There should now be a new menu item called Configure encrypted volumes.
* After you select it, you will be asked to confirm the deletion of data on
  partitions marked to be erased and possibly other actions such as writing a
  new partition table.
* For large partitions this might take some time.

'''

* Next you will be asked to enter a passphrase for partitions configured to
  use one.
* Good passphrases should be longer than 8 characters, should be a mixture of
  letters, numbers and other characters and should not contain common
  dictionary words or information easily associable with you (such as
  birthdates, hobbies, pet names, names of family members or relatives, etc.).

[WARNING]
====
* Before you input any passphrases, you should have made sure that your
  keyboard is configured correctly and generates the expected characters.
* If you are unsure, you can switch to the second virtual console and type
  some text at the prompt.
* This ensures that you won't be surprised later, e.g. by trying to input a
  passphrase using a qwerty keyboard layout when you used an azerty layout
  during the installation.
* This situation can have several causes.
* Maybe you switched to another keyboard layout during the installation, or
  the selected keyboard layout might not have been set up yet when entering
  the passphrase for the root file system.
====

* If you selected to use methods other than a passphrase to create encryption
  keys, they will be generated now.
* Because the kernel may not have gathered a sufficient amount of entropy at
  this early stage of the installation, the process may take a long time.
* You can help speed up the process by generating entropy: e.g. by pressing
  random keys, or by switching to the shell on the second virtual console and
  generating some network and disk traffic (downloading some files, feeding
  big files into /dev/null, etc.).
* This will be repeated for each partition to be encrypted.

'''

* After returning to the main partitioning menu, you will see all encrypted
  volumes as additional partitions which can be configured in the same way as
  ordinary partitions.
* The following example shows a volume encrypted via dm-crypt.
+
[subs=quotes]
....
Encrypted volume (_sda2_crypt_) - 115.1 GB Linux device-mapper
	#1 115.1 GB F ext3
....

* Now is the time to assign mount points to the volumes and optionally change
  the file system types if the defaults do not suit you.

'''

* Pay attention to the identifiers in parentheses (`_sda2_crypt_` in this case)
  and the mount points you assigned to each encrypted volume.
* You will need this information later when booting the new system.
* The differences between the ordinary boot process and the boot process with
  encryption involved will be covered later in Section 7.2.

'''

* Once you are satisfied with the partitioning scheme, continue with the
  installation.
