== D.1 Linux Devices

* In Linux various special files can be found under the directory `/dev`.
* These files are called device files and behave unlike ordinary files.
* The most common types of device files are for block devices and character
  devices.
* These files are an interface to the actual driver (part of the Linux kernel)
  which in turn accesses the hardware.
* Another, less common, type of device file is the named _pipe_.
* The most important device files are listed in the tables below.

|sda	|First hard disk
|sdb	|Second hard disk
|sda1	|First partition of the first hard disk
|sdb7	|Seventh partition of the second hard disk

== D.2 Disk Space Needed for Tasks

* A standard installation for the amd64 architecture, including all standard
  packages and using the default kernel, takes up 1242MB of disk space.
* A minimal base installation, without the "Standard system" task selected,
  will take 1012MB.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* In both cases this is the actual disk space used _after_ the installation is
  finished and any temporary files deleted.
* It also does not take into account overhead used by the file system, for
  example for journal files.
* This means that significantly more disk space is needed both _during_ the
  installation and for normal system use.
====

* The following table lists sizes reported by aptitude for the tasks listed in
  tasksel.
* Note that some tasks have overlapping constituents, so the total installed
  size for two tasks together may be less than the total obtained by adding up
  the numbers.

'''

* By default the installer will install the GNOME desktop environment, but
  alternative desktop environments can be selected either by using one of the
  special installation images, or by specifying the desired desktop
  environment during installation (see Section 6.3.6.2).

'''

* Note that you will need to add the sizes listed in the table to the size of
  the standard installation when determining the size of partitions.
* Most of the size listed as "Installed size" will end up in `/usr` and in
  `/lib`; the size listed as "Download size" is (temporarily) required in
  `/var`.

[%autowidth]

|Task		|Installed size (MB)	|Download size (MB)	|Space needed to install (MB)

|SSH server	|2						|1					|3
|===

* If you install in a language other than English, *tasksel* may automatically
  install a _localization task_, if one is available for your language.
* Space requirements differ per language; you should allow up to 350MB in
  total for download and installation.
