= Chapter 3 Before Installing Debian GNU/Linux

* This chapter deals with the preparation for installing Debian before you
  even boot the installer.
* This includes backing up your data, gathering information about your
  hardware, and locating any necessary information.

== 3.1 Overview of the Installation Process

* Here's a road map for the steps you will take during the installation
  process.

1. Back up any existing data or documents on the hard disk where you plan to
   install.
2. Gather information about your computer and any needed documentation, before
   starting the installation.
3. Locate and/or download the installer software and any specialized driver or
   firmware files your machine requires.
4. Set up boot media such as CDs/DVDs/USB sticks or provide a network boot
   infrastructure from which the installer can be booted.
5. Boot the installation system.
6. Select the installation language.
7. Activate the ethernet network connection, if available.
8. If necessary, resize existing partitions on your target hard disk to make
   space for the installation.

10. Watch the automatic download/install/setup of the base system.
11. Select and install additional software.
12. Install a boot loader which can start up Debian GNU/Linux and/or your
	existing system.
13. Load the newly installed system for the first time.
