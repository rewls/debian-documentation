== 2.5. Memory and Disk Space Requirements

* You must have at least 780MB of memory and 1160MB of hard disk space to
  perform a normal installation.
* Note that these are fairly minimal numbers.
* For more realistic figures, see Section 3.4, "Meeting Minimum Hardware
  Requirements".

'''

* The installer normally automatically enables memory-saving tricks to be able
  to run on such low-memory system, but on architectures that are less tested
  it may miss doing so.
* It can however be enabled manually by appending the `lowmem=1` or even
  `lowmem=2` boot parameter (see also Section 6.3.1.1, "Check available memory /
  low memory mode" and Section 5.3.2, "Debian Installer Parameters").

'''

* Installation on systems with less memory or disk space available may be
  possible but is only advised for experienced users.
