= Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)

* *Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)* -- The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw, and gufw
  - a Graphical User Interface version of the same) is a frontend for iptables
  and is particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls.
* Ufw provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line
  interface for manipulating the firewall.

== Installation

* Uncomplicated Firewall can be easily installed by typing this command into
  the terminal as a super user:
+
[source,sh]
# apt-get install ufw

* However, simply installing the firewall will not turn it on automatically,
  nor it will have any rule set by default.

== Configuration

[WARNING]
====
* If you are configuring over SSH, you may wish to allow SSH before enabling
  the firewall.
* If your connection gets interrupted before allowing SSH you may be locked
  out of your system.
====

* Firstly, the firewall must be enabled by typing:
+
[source,sh]
# ufw enable

[NOTE]
====
* it may be disabled the same way, by replacing _enable_ with _disable_.
====

* Secondly, defaults must be set up.
* For normal users the following defaults will do just fine.
+
[source,sh]
# ufw default deny incoming
# ufw default allow outgoing

* Next, it is recommended to verify that the firewall is enabled by typing:
+
[source,sh]
# ufw status verbose

[NOTE]
====
* With this command you will also be able to see all of the defaults and rules
  which you have applied.
