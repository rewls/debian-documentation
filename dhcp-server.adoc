= DHCP_Server

== Introduction

* When you set up a Local Area Network (LAN), a client needs to have certain
  information, such as the IP-address of its interface, the IP-address of at
  least one domain name server, and the IP-address of a server in the LAN that
  serves as a router to the internet.
* In the manual setup you have to type in this information for each client
  anew.
* With the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) the computers can do
  that automatically for you.
* This is particularly convenient for connecting laptops to the network.

'''

* For a simple configuration of your network you can set up one computer (e.g.
  the one connected to the internet) as a DHCP server and each of the other
  computers as a DHCP_Client.
