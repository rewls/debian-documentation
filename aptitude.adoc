= Aptitude

== Introduction

* Aptitude is an Ncurses and command-line based front-end to numerous Apt
  libraries, which are also used by Apt, the default Debian package manager.
* Aptitude is text based and run from a terminal.

'''

* Aptitude has a number of useful features, including:
** a mutt-like syntax for matching packages in a flexible manner
** mark packages as "automatically installed" or "manually installed" so that
   packages can be auto-removed when no longer required (feature available in
   Apt, too, since quite a few Debian release)
** preview of actions about to be taken with different colors marking
   different actions
** persistence of user actions (similar to dselect)
** the ability to interactively retrieve and display the Debian changelog of
   all available official packages
** apt-like (i.e. apt-get and apt-cache) command line mode ("aptitude install
   foo")
** Score-based dependency resolver which is more suitable for interactive
   dependency resolution with additional hints from the user like "I don't
   want that part of the solution but keep that other part of the solution for
   your next try". +
   Apt's dependency resolver on the other hand is optimized for good "one
   shot" solutions.

* The primary command is "aptitude", as is the name of its primary Debian
  package.
