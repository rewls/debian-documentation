= NetworkConfiguration

== 4 ways to configure the network

* The interfaces configuration file at /etc/network/interfaces (this page):
  for basic or simple configurations (e.g. workstation)
* NetworkManager: This is the default for Laptop configuration
* Systemd: Debian reference Doc Chapter 5
* Netplan: Debian reference Doc Chapter 5

== Setting up an Ethernet Interface

* The majority of network setup can be done via the `interfaces` configuration
  file at `/etc/network/interfaces`.
* Here, you can give your network card an IP address (or use dhcp), set up
  routing information, configure IP masquerading, set default routes and much
  more.

'''

* Remember to add interfaces that you want brought up at boot time to the
  'auto' line.

* See `man interfaces` for more options.

== Starting and Stopping Interfaces

* Interfaces configured with `/etc/network/interfaces` can be brought up and
  down with the `ifup` and `ifdown` commands.

'''

* Some outdated guides instruct to restart the networking service to apply
  changes to `/etc/network/interfaces`, however this was deprecated because it
  is possible that not all interfaces will be restarted.
* Instead use `ifup` and `ifdown` to apply changes to each interface, for
  example with an interface named enp7s0:

[source,sh]
# ifdown enp7s0
# ifup enp7s0
